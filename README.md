# NESTLE-SALES-ANALYSIS
This project generates insights into Nestle's product sales performance from the year 2018-2020. It also provides recommendations that can increase and boost sales performance.

# INSIGHTS:

- From the Data/sales analysis, I observed the products with the highest sales rates are Milo and Nescafe, hence producing the highest revenue. Nescafe gold and Maggi produced the lowest revenue. I recommend the manufacturers should constantly keep a consistent supply of the popular items on hand.

- The 3-year sales show Milo and Nescafe as the products with the highest revenue.

- The monthly sales trend by Revenue shows that the month of December had a very low revenue. I recommend the business/organization launch a special deal by this time that will result in a price drop and boost sales performance.
 
- By location, South Australia has the highest sales by Revenue.

Analysis and Visualization were done using Tableau.
